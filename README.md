# Ba-Eu-interference-prediction-

The reg_tree.py implements the model trees for element Ba interference on Eu prediction models.

When treeExplore.py runs two variables tolS and tolN are necessary. 

The first parameter tolS is the tolerance on the Ba interference on the Eu error reduction, and the second parameter tolN is the minimum Ba related to Eu data instances in a split. 

The model trees are sensitive to the settings used for tolS and tolN.  

Different settings of tolS and tolN yield different prediction models.
