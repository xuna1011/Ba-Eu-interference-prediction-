# Ba-Eu-interference-prediction-

When you run treeExplore.py reg_tree.py in python for the model tree for element interference prediction models, two variables tolS and tolN are necessary. 
The first parameter tolS is the tolerance on the Ba interference on the Eu error reduction, and the second parameter tolN is the minimum Ba related to Eu data instances in a split. 
The model trees are sensitive to the settings used for tolS and tolN.  
Different settings of tolS and tolN yield different prediction models.
